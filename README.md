# hexadecimalQuiz

*** Incomplete ***

Simple quiz on the decimal values of randomly selected hexadecimal values

Conversion program converts a given number into binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal, or just one of these if specified.

Uses 64 bit unsigned integers, so largest number is (2^64)-1 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
