# hexadecimalQuiz

*** Incomplete ***

Simple quiz on the decimal values of randomly selected hexadecimal values

I created a class for working with hexadecimal values, however this was just for practice. 
This class is not actually needed for the program to work...


Uses 64 bit unsigned integers, so largest number is (2^64)-1 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
